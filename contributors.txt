Contributing to APE:

APE is AFL. That means it cannot be used for commercial uses. 

Contributors, however, may use the project code for their 
own work, commercial or not.

Contributors *should* use project code in their own work. 
The code is designed to be used in real projects. Real 
projects can identify shortcomings and lead to improvements.

One way to get started is by reviewing commits and leaving 
comments on GitHub under "Commits" -> "Comments".
